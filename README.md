# Dreamscape
A SaaS (software as a service) product that utilizes AI models from Replicate and OpenAI. Features include image, video, audio & code generation, and the ability to have a conversation.
<strong>Some features such as Image and Video Generation may not work as Vercel limits the API timeout to about 10 seconds in the Free/Hobby plan.</strong><br>
